		<MudText Class="mt-6" Style="color: #E3E3E6; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; font-weight: 700;">Why Incorporate a CSI Program?</MudText>
		<MudText Class="mt-6" Style="color: #E3E3E6; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400;">Without a follow-up program, businesses remain unaware of most customer complaints. The vast majority of upset customers won’t complain to you. Most will simply avoid confrontation, go away mad, and take their business with them. It costs ten times as much to attract a new customer as it does to retain an existing customer, so it’s imperative to know about customer dissatisfaction, and to keep the customers you have happy.</MudText>
		<MudText Class="mt-6 mb-6" Style="color: #E3E3E6; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400;">A customer satisfaction indexing (CSI) program - sometimes referred to as a customer experience (CX, CE) or customer experience management (CXM, CEM) program - provides the information you need to salvage customers, learn strengths and weaknesses from your customers’ perspective, and implement proper processes and improve employee performance. CSI information is also commonly used to set standards and establish a benchmark to maintain them. A net promoter score (NPS) takes CSI a step further. The NPS has a strong correlation with revenue growth, along with the added benefit of having a standardized calculation, allowing for comparisons to other businesses.</MudText>

CRI utilizes all survey methodologies, including outbound and inbound live agent telephone, IVR telephone, email, direct mail, text, and strategic blends of the various methods.</MudText>
		<MudText Class="mt-6" Style="color: #676773; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400;">A primary goal is to gather the largest amount of high quality information in a very timely manner. The process must cater to the customer, and leave a positive impression. This is why CRI prefers to keep questionnaires brief. At the same time, the survey results are delivered rapidly, allowing clients to resolve dissatisfaction immediately.</MudText>
		<MudText Class="mt-6 mb-6" Style="color: #676773; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400;">Completed survey results are emailed to management immediately. These “E-Results” are completely customizable per user by survey result urgency. All ground-level detail, as well as aggregate summary reporting which displays Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s), is also posted real-time on the secure CRI website.</MudText>
		<MudText Class="mt-6" Style="color: #676773; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400;">CRI web reporting includes individual survey results, which include interactive CRM functions, to aggregate summary reports. You can only improve upon something you can measure, and CRI allows you to benchmark and monitor your CSI using real-time, secure web-based reporting for all clients. CRI prides itself on custom report development, designing directly around the desires of the client. CRI is also very nimble, and is able to develop custom solutions quickly, whether building a CSI program from the ground up, or modifying existing offerings.</MudText>
		<MudText Class="mt-6 mb-6" Style="color: #676773; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400;">CRI also provides “group” aggregate reporting for enterprise clients. Databases and various levels of login access several layers deep are provided (e.g., login levels with specific results per location, district, region and national).</MudText>

		<MudText Class="mt-6" Style="color: #E3E3E6; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; font-weight: 700;">The Ultimate Value of CSI</MudText>
		<MudText Class="mt-6 mb-6" Style="color: #E3E3E6; font-size: 14px;">CRI CSI programs provide businesses with the tools to uncover important information from the customer. This not only allows you to salvage customers, but also shows customers you care. At the same time, processes can be improved and employee behavior can be elevated, especially when incorporating incentive programs. Then, benchmarking the metrics at a high level allows you to adjust and improve business practices and processes. Finally, CSI data can be marketed, displaying evidence that you meet high levels of customer satisfaction.</MudText>
